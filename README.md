### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dana!

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I attended University of Texas for their Full Stack Web Development course and am excited to work in a role where mentorship and growth are encouraged! 

- âœ¨ Iâ€™m currently reinforcing my knowledge of JavaScript and PHP.
- âž¡ The next language I am wanting to learn is going to be C ++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am horrible at karaoke but I love it.
